# Project Overview

## Introduction
The Number Guessing Game is a small Python program where the user tries to guess a number chosen by the computer. It keeps giving hints until the correct number is guessed.

## Aim of the Project
- To practice Python basics
- To learn using VS Code
- To understand Git commands
- To upload a project on GitHub

## How the Game Works
1. A number between 1 to 100 is generated.
2. The user types a guess.
3. Program shows:
   - Too high
   - Too low
   - Correct
4. Shows total attempts.

## Why I Chose This Project
I chose this because it is simple to understand and good for practicing loops, conditions, and input handling.
